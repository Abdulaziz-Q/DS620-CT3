# DS620-CT3
Critical Thinking Assignment 3 is part of DS620 (Data Visualization) course

### CT3: Data Storytelling

In this critical thinking, our mission is to create an MS Power BI dashboard file Dummy Marketing and Sales dataset, which includes information about different promotion budgets and sales. (The dataset from Kaggle in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/harrimansaragih/dummy-advertising-and-sales-data). The first aim is to create an explanation for the various promotions seen in the dataset. In the second objective, we will construct a dashboard that displays the results of several promotions. In the third objective, we'll create a story that consumers will be able to see clearly in our visualizations. The last objective is to write a summary of your observations and outcomes.
